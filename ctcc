Shanaya Edwards Issues

Cherokee Town & Country Club

Shanaya and I are both interns at Cherokee with Escoffier. I started April 10 and Shanaya has been with Cherokee since February.

Thursday - May 12

Shanaya and I were working in the same kitchen as usual and I tried to help her finish pulling meat for an event. She said she had it and didn't need any help. This was a usual response in a very short tone so I asked her if she just didn't like me or did not like working with me.

Shanaya replied "I think you are rude and do not want to work with you." SHe had mentioned this before. I said there needed to be teamwork and it was being professional to work with people you may not like and I had been nothing but professional and respectful to her since we have met. 

I had suspected Shanaya's attitude toward me since we met since we rarely speak except for hello and goodbye.

Thursday - Maty 19

I was working in the blast freezer putting in veal stock when Shanaya stpped in front of me and moved a shelf and one of my pans. She closed the door and walked away like I wasn't even there. I spoke to her five minutes later and mentioned she was rude a monment ago and she said "I was doing what I was told." I also said I was doing the same and it was rude just to move pans and ignore me. We had done the same project together a week before, so she was very away of what I was doing.

This was around 8pm and she continued to complain about me to Chefs Andrew and Todd non-stop for several minutes. I just continued to do my project and ignored the situation.

Friday - May 20

I was working at a carving station Friday night and Shanaya was working on pizza. 

At the end of the evening, I was leaving, however, Shanaya said "she was supposed to make sure I stayed behind the carving station all night." I was unaware of the closing procedures and stayed but I felt put on the spot since this was not communicated to me by Chefs Todd or Scott.

Conclusion
