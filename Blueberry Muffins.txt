Sure thing! Here’s a classic blueberry muffin recipe for you:

### Blueberry Muffins

**Ingredients:**
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 1 large egg
- 1/3 cup milk (plus more if needed)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
- 2 tablespoons flour (to toss the blueberries)

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the vegetable oil, egg, milk, and vanilla extract.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. If the batter is too thick, add a little more milk.
5. Toss the blueberries with the 2 tablespoons of flour (this helps prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the muffins) and gently fold them into the batter.
6. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
8. Let the muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
