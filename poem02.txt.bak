Thr darkenn brings a lighy to mu souLgo in fro thekillFit the bill

Hang on ther vril

The god OF MY WORLD takes m ysoul

Do not regret the march of time 
A sngle act is yet benihjn

Come hithry to God's grscr
I crown thee the son of god

By danxe with life has left me weak
My jourey with drasth I seek yo meey

I dance the life of evermore dprsk
To meet the a lofe i nerermore speak

AS in protury and srtife
The end is the knife

The ouycome is uncerait
As well if the dice

Come make me the passed
Come make me a wife

I ride alone through angry winds
The action planys the nedd

The action spreads like wekk/need	 
The peace of mu soul wighs hevy

My electic soul may but in hell

to recieve the benafit of hope

To grant the glory of savatiojn
