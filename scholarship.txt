My name is Tom Dibble Dempsey and I started my culinary program with Escoffier.edu last April. I have completed the first two classes with flying success and currently in the pastry class for the foundation track.

I have been in the industry for twenty years starting out in restaurants when I was at university. I was a waiter, pizza cook and bartender - and was very fortunate to have a husband/wife team who took me under the wings and instilled a very strong Italian work etheic and well as teaching the cooking and restaurant management. I started as a pizza cook with Camille and Robert - and was the general manager when I left five years later. The reason I left was I worked 60 hours a week and was unable to finish school. They were very supportive and we stayed closed until they passed.

With determination, I did graduate from Georgia State University with two degress - computer science and business. I also had a very successful IT career for the next 20 years until I aged out of the industry. 

I tell you people I meet "know how to wait tables or bartend, because you never know what will happen in life."

Fortunately for me, I still had the strong love of the hospitality industry and moved back to restaurants and sports stadiums for the last 10 years. But I yearned for more so I investigated the Escoffier program to become a fully certified chef in 2022 and open my own place. I am looking to open a coffe shop and bakery next year and reopen the Italian restaurant I mentioned earlier under the same name. Robert gave me his blessing and recipes before he passed even though I have all the recipes in my head.

Opening a running a restaurant is not an easy task but I am lucky to have the experience and training to succeed and to help others make a living and succeed as well. 

A scholarship would help be start the next chapter of my life by relieving some of my finacial burden and let me focus on my future success.
