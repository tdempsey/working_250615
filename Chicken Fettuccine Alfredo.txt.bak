Ingredients
Chicken

AD
2 large chicken breasts pounded even
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
Fettuccine Alfredo
½ cup unsalted butter
2 garlic cloves minced
2 cups heavy cream warmed to room temperature
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
2 cups fresh grated Parmesan cheese
16 ounces uncooked fettuccine noodles fresh or dried
Instructions
Drizzle and rub 1 tablespoon of olive oil on the chicken breasts. Sprinkle with salt, fresh ground black pepper, and Italian seasoning.
Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet or a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken until it is golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Remove from the skillet, put it on a cutting board, cover loosely with an aluminum foil tent, and let it rest. 
Melt the butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute while stirring. Whisk in the cream, salt, fresh ground black pepper, and Italian seasoning. Simmer until slightly thickened but do not boil. Reduce the heat as low as it will go and stir in the Parmesan Cheese until melted. 
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the fettuccini noodles and cook al dente according to the package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and drain well.
Add the fettuccine noodles to the Alfredo sauce. Cut the chicken into thin slices and add it to the pasta. Season with more salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. If desired, sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. 
Notes
Use a meat mallet to pound the chicken breast to an even thickness. This will help the chicken breast cook uniformly.
For optimum taste, cook the pasta al dente according to package instructions. That means slightly firm with a little bite to it.
Do not overcook the chicken. Chicken is done when the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees on an instant-read meat thermometer.
Tent the chicken and let it rest. This allows the juices to redistribute more evenly so that when you slice it, all the moisture does not flow out.
Reserve 1/2 cup or so of pasta water. If needed, use it in 1-2 tablespoon increments to thin the pasta sauce.
Warm the cream to room temperature by placing it in a microwave-safe measuring cup and heat it for 30-second intervals at 50% power until warm.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. See here for more about reheating fettuccine alfredo. You can also reheat in the microwave at reduced power.
To freeze, first cool, then spoon into a sturdy freezer container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the microwave at reduced power or on the stovetop on low.
