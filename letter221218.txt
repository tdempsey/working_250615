Georgia LGBTQ History Project - Year-End Tax-Deductible Donation

Thank you for supporting the Georgia LGBTQ History Project.

The Georgia LGBTQ History Project is a group of archivists, librarians, and community volunteers dedicated to preserving Georgia뭩 LGBTQ+ history. Our goal is to preserve personal collections, as well as newspapers and periodicals, held by community members and to raise awareness among LGBTQ+ Georgians of their rich history and past events. There are many institutions working to preserve our history including, but not limited to, Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System, Atlanta History Center, Atlanta University Center, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Oglethorpe University and Touching Up Our Roots.

Your generous contribution will help us continue our work with the community to preserve our history in Georgia by:

         Connecting individual donors to collecting institutions. 

         Holding digital preservation and personal archiving workshops

         Hosting monthly meetings, an ongoing speaker series, and occasional panel discussions

         Organizing collecting drives and outreach

         Exhibit creation [I don뭪 think we have done this in past, but something cool for the future]

         Web presence - website and Facebook

         Creating partnerships with institutions, organizations, and individuals

         In-person meetings throughout the county [not sure about this one, I may just use the below bullet point]

         Connecting with folks across the country
