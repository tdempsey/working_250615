- What proved to be more difficult than you originally thought?

I initially thought doing a cooking class online would be a challenge but found the process to be successful. I have cooked for years in restaurants and it is great to have a teacher/manager/co-worker next to you to guide and verify your work as you. While I could have done a few things better in this class I did get great feedback to improve my skills. 

- What seemed less difficult than you originally thought?

The whole "cooking class online" was a mystery to me at the beginning since I am used to in-class instruction and on-the-job. I also do not finish most online classes (computer) losing interest or getting bored but I found online working well for me. I was able to view videos several times making sure I got the information and the book is great.

My time management was also less difficult that I thought thanks to chef messages to remind me of tasks due.

- How would you assess that your skills have improved since you started the program?

There were two reasons I decided to enroll in this program - fill in gaps in my knowledge and prepare to become an official chef. I have cooked in restaurants for years and have a solid background and I learned a great deal I did not know and firmed up my past knowledge. 

I now have more confidence in my abilities and feel I succeed in my future plans thanks to this training. Also, when I talk to fellow chefs a co-workers about being with Escoffier.edu they are genuinely impressed and supportive. This program has become a source of pride in my life and I am proud to be learning with Escoffier.

- Where are you going to concentrate efforts towards improvement moving forward?

My goal is to be a baker and open a café so that is my plan. I am also a difficult manager expecting too much from people so I am working on my soft skills and how I communicate with staff and co-workers. Everyone knows I will always enforce standards but I believe there is a better way to do so without being a tyrant.

This class has also opened my eyes to the many different opportunities I had not considered before and showing me you don't have to necessarily work in a traditional restaurant to succeed in hospitality. 

I am being drawn to hotel operations since they have great kitchen concepts and capital to implement them. Hotels and corporate are also stable work environments and opportunities to grow.
