My name is Tom Dibble Dempsey and I have lived in Atlanta, Georgia for the last 40 years hailing from the Charleston, SC area. 

I moved to Atlanta for the culture andf to finish my college career at Georgia State University earning a Computer Science and Business degee. While at Georgia Stae, I was very involved the the GSU alliance.

Early on, I was very involved with the LGBTQ community in Atlanta working with GLADD, HRC, Georgia Equlity and other organizations. I am currently the president of the Geogia LGBTQ History project - a 501(c)3 non-profit preserving the history of Atlanta andf Georgia by archive at all the local universites and the Atlanta History Center. We have a very robust Facebook page with daily emepheral pasts on our past streuggles ande successes. We also hold a monthly Zoom with featured speakers with the last Zoom honoring Dr. Jesse Peel and his contr4ibitions to Atlanta featuring Mark King as our main speaker.

My current projects include expanding the History Project's mission and digitizing our past publication further. Kennesaw State has recently digisized the 1988-1994 editions of Southern Voice and we plan to work with our partners to ditigized the rest as well as Cruise and Etceterta magazines. I am also working with Auburn Avenure Library to digitize their African-American magazines from the last few decades and working to find the copyright owners.
