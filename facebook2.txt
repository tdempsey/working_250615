I'm looking for 20-40 people to play Mega Millions @ 25.00 each. If won, the payout will be between $4-9M depending on the number of players. The odds are high but a group purchase would increase our chances. I will be employing the "Dempsey Lottery System" to filter out bad plays and increase the odds of winning. (the mega ball is a bitch) Only 21+. Message me if interested. The jackpot is $284 Million and growing.
