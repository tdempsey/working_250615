I have been doing memory work on Facebook with past albums and realized it has been 30 years since my heydays in Virginia-Highland (that's a yuppy neighborhood in Atlanta). 
I moved here in 1984 and worked my way up to a computer programmer graduating within 8 years. My career started and I was very well off for 10+ years.
Around 2002, things went up and down for the next 10 years only to start a slow decline into today. 
I believe the best days are to come.I have been doing memory work on Facebook with past albums and realized it has been 30 years since my heydays in Virginia-Highland (that's a yuppy neighborhood in Atlanta).
