### Chicken Parmesan with Marinade

**Ingredients:**

**For the Marinade:**
- 2 large chicken breasts, butterflied and pounded to even thickness
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

**For the Chicken Parmesan:**
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Fresh basil, for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a large resealable plastic bag, combine olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
   - Add the chicken breasts to the bag, seal it, and massage the marinade into the chicken.
   - Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.

2. **Prepare the Coating:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - In a shallow dish, combine breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
   - Place the flour in a separate shallow dish and the beaten eggs in another.

3. **Bread the Chicken:**
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off.
   - Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour, shaking off excess, then dip in the beaten eggs, and finally coat with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing lightly to adhere.

4. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - In a large oven-safe skillet, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.
   - Add the breaded chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.
   - Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.

5. **Assemble the Chicken Parmesan:**
   - Remove the skillet from the oven and spoon marinara sauce over each piece of chicken.
   - Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the top.
   - Return the skillet to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5-7 minutes.

6. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with fresh basil and serve with your favorite pasta or a side salad.
